	journal = {Physica Scripta},
	abstract = {A lattice size dependence of the helicity modulus for the two-dimensional XY-model is inferred by aid of the Coulomb gas-vortex analogy and an explicit form of this dependence is obtained from a set of self-consistent equations for the Coulomb gas. High precision Monte Carlo simulations in conjunction with this inferred lattice size dependence is used to determine the critical temperature. Some other recent results in the literature are discussed in the light of the present investigation.}
