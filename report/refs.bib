	abstract = {A lattice model is proposed in order to explain the peculiar properties of liquid helium II. In the present model, liquid is regarded as a lattice composed of atoms and holes. Each atom can migrate by exchanging its position with an adjacent hole if the latter exists. In terms of operators which create or annihilate an atom at each lattice point, the kinetic and potential energies are defined so as to have a correct form in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing. Then it is proved that the grand partition function of our lattice liquid is equal to the partition function of a system of vector spins subjected to an external magnetic field, provided a proper identification is made between corresponding quantities of both systems. Various approximation methods used in the problem of ferromagnets are appliciable and enable us to attain the results which explain most of the characteristic features of liquid helium.},

High precision Monte Carlo simulations in conjunction with this inferred lattice size dependence is used to determine the critical temperature. Some other recent results in the literature are discussed in the light of the present investigation.}

	abstract = {A new definition of order called topological order is proposed for two-dimensional systems in which no long-range order of the conventional type exists. The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.}
