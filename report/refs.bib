	abstract = {We explain in detail how to estimate mean values and assess statistical errors for arbitrary functions of elementary observables in Monte Carlo simulations. The method is to estimate and sum the relevant autocorrelation functions, which is argued to produce more certain error estimates than binning techniques and hence to help toward a better exploitation of expensive simulations. An effective integrated autocorrelation time is computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest. A Matlab code is offered for download that implements the method. It can also combine independent runs (replica) allowing to judge their consistency.}

	abstract = {A lattice model is proposed in order to explain the peculiar properties of liquid helium II. In the present model, liquid is regarded as a lattice composed of atoms and holes. Each atom can migrate by exchanging its position with an adjacent hole if the latter exists. In terms of operators which create or annihilate an atom at each lattice point, the kinetic and potential energies are defined so as to have a correct form in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing. Then it is proved that the grand partition function of our lattice liquid is equal to the partition function of a system of vector spins subjected to an external magnetic field, provided a proper identification is made between corresponding quantities of both systems. Various approximation methods used in the problem of ferromagnets are appliciable and enable us to attain the results which explain most of the characteristic features of liquid helium.},

The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.}
