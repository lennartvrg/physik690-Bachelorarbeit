	journal = {Physica Scripta},
	abstract = {A lattice size dependence of the helicity modulus for the two-dimensional XY-model is inferred by aid of the Coulomb gas-vortex analogy and an explicit form of this dependence is obtained from a set of self-consistent equations for the Coulomb gas. High precision Monte Carlo simulations in conjunction with this inferred lattice size dependence is used to determine the critical temperature. Some other recent results in the literature are discussed in the light of the present investigation.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics},
	abstract = {A new definition of order called topological order is proposed for two-dimensional systems in which no long-range order of the conventional type exists. The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.}
