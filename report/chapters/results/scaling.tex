	In~\Cref{fig:schema}, we observe that the total simulation time $T$ is proportional to $L^2$. The Wolff algorithm takes $\sim \frac{1}{2}$ the time of the Metropolis while, as discussed in~\Cref{sec:res:temperature}, coming to a more precise estimate. As the Metropolis algorithm used $24$ chunks and the Wolff algorithm only $6$ chunks, we conclude that the cluster building procedure of the Wolff algorithm is computationally more expensive than a single sweep of the Metropolis procedure. Note that the simulation ran on a compute cluster in the public cloud, so we cannot account for the effects of noisy neighbours and other external factors.
