\section{Vortex Unbinding}\label{sec:vortex_unbinding}
	To visualize the vortex unbinding at low temperatures, we performed a single run where we first heated a $64 \times 64$ lattice  to $T = \num{1.5}$ and allowed it to thermalize for $\num{100 000}$ sweeps. The temperature was then lowered back down to $T = \num{0.05}$ in $90$ steps with $20$ sweeps of thermalization at each temperature step. At $T = \num{0.05}$, the system was given $\num{90 000}$ sweeps to allow the vortices to unbind. An animation of the procedure can be viewed here\todo{Upload to some video platform}, with some key frames shown  \todo{Still need to export them from the animation and put them in the appendix}
	
	Below the critical temperature $T_C$, bound vortex-antivortex pairs appear. As the temperature is further lowered, the pairs come closer together until they annihilate. The lattice is left in a quasi-ordered low-temperature state.
