\section{Procedure}
	We propose and implement the following procedure to mitigate the shortcomings mentioned before. The various subsystems of the simulation are described in \Cref{sec:impl:scanning,sec:impl:computing,sec:impl:tasks}.
	
	The high-level procedure is as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The database schema (\Cref{chap:schema}) is initialized by the compute nodes in~\Cref{sec:impl:computing:compute}.
		\item The compute nodes read the configuration file from the current working directory.
		\item The initial temperature interval is divided into steps according to~\cref{scanning:init} of~\Cref{sec:theo:wolff_cluster}. The resulting configurations --- defined by the algorithm (Metropolis or Wolff), the lattice size $L$, and the temperature $T$ --- are inserted into the database if they do not already exist.
		\item The program checks whether any existing configuration is incomplete and, if so, executes the task pipeline defined in~\Cref{sec:impl:tasks}.
		\item One of the compute nodes simulates the annihilation of the vortex/antivortex pair.
	\end{enumerate}
