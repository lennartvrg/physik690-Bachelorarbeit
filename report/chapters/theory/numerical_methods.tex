\section{Numerical Methods}
	As stated in the introduction in~\cref{chap:introduction}, the goal is to simulate the two dimensional XY model with periodic boundary conditions using the Metropolis-Hastings and the Wolff-Cluster algorithms. In the following section I will present the concepts needed for understanding and implementing the simulation.
	
	\subsection{Importance Sampling}
		

	\subsection{Metropolis Algorithm}
	
	
		The overall procedure for the lattice is as follows:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Calculate $E$, $M$ and $\Gamma$ for the initial lattice configuration.
			\item Perform a lattice sweep by iterating over all lattice sites. For every site $i$ do:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Propose a new angle $\theta_i \in [0,2\pi)$ from a uniform distribution.
				\item Calculate $\Delta H = \Delta E$, $\Delta M$ and $\Delta \Gamma$ for the proposed new state.
				\item Accept or reject state with probability $P = \min{(1, \exp{(-\beta\Delta H)})}$.
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Update the observables $E \mathrel{{+}{=}} \Delta E$ and $M \mathrel{{+}{=}} \Delta M$ and add them to the result set.
			\item Repeat from 2. for a total of $N$ sweeps.
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\subsection{Wolff Cluster Algorithm}
		
	
	\subsection{Bootstrapping}
		Since the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm scales with the number of lattice sites, it is computationally impractical to run the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for long timescales. Given that we have an observable whose iid samples follow a Gaussian distribution and we already have \enquote{enough} iid samples which cover enough of the possible configuration space, we can then use bootstrapping to generate more samples (\citet{bootstrap}).
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Collect $B$ intermediate means by repeating the following:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Take $A$ random samples from the blocked samples obtained in~\cref{sec:blocking} with replacement.
				\item Calculate the mean of those samples and add the result to the set of intermediate means.
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Calculate the final mean and the sample standard deviation of those $B$ intermediate means.
		\end{enumerate}
